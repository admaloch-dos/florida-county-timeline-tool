# when-it-was-where

About: 
This is a Florida county history search tool, informally referred to as, "When it was where", built to assist the State Archives of Florida reference room staff. Patrons often request information about the history and timeline of certain counties in Florida and need to look through tons of old maps and documents to find what they are looking for. The intent of this project was to combine our collection of maps and county database info into a single interactive tool that would simplify the research process and save hours of time for both the patrons and archives staff. 

Technologies used: 
This was built with HTML, CSS, Javascript and some libraries including ImageMapster for HTML image mapping, and OpenSeaDragon which is a high resolution image viewer plugin. 

Challenges: 
The most challenging part of this project was figuring out a way to effectively bring together our set of maps, data and documents that donâ€™t always overlap or directly correspond to each other in a logical way. The resulting tool allows a user to choose any modern county, view its entire timeline, and search by year to filter the timeline information and show a map of what the chosen county and the rest of Florida looked like at the time. 

Status:
The project is mostly finished and will be implemented on the Florida Memory website, but is awaiting completion while our historian finishes up some of the data used for the county timeline histories.

<b>Note:</b><br/> 
The Florida Department of State is very security focused and version control software is not allowed so you may not see a much of a detailed commit history for this project.
